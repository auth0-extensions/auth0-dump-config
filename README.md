# auth0-dump-config - DEPRECATED!


> The functionionality from the project has been rolled into [auth0-deploy-cli](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-deploy-cli) as `a0deploy export`. Please see the [options](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-deploy-cli#cli-options) on that repo.

Auth0 configuration dump tool. Command line tool for dumping your configuration to Auth0.


## Installation
```bash
npm install -g auth0-dump-config
```

## Setup
You need a configured client on Auth0 and a config file to run the tool.
1. Create a deploy client : see [auth0-deploy-cli README](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-deploy-cli/blob/master/README.md).
1. Create the credentials file : refer to the sample file `a0deploy_config.json.sample` and fill in the credentials.
You can find them in the settings of the client you created.

## Usage

#### Import configuration
```bash
a0dump -c /path/to/a0deploy_config.json -o /path/to/config/files
```

#### Repository Structure
The repository structure is the same as [auth0-deploy-cli](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-deploy-cli).
